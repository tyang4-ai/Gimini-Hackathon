# WorkshopCopilot Positioning Statement

## Primary Positioning

**For:** Makers, hobbyists, and makerspace members who work with 3D printers, laser cutters, and basic woodworking tools

**Who:** Need real-time safety oversight when working alone and immediate visual troubleshooting when projects fail

**The:** WorkshopCopilot (AI workshop assistant)

**Is:** A voice-first AI companion that continuously watches your physical workspace through a webcam

**That:** Proactively warns you about safety hazards before accidents happen and visually diagnoses problems when you show it failed prints, bad cuts, or equipment issues

**Unlike:** YouTube tutorials (can't see your specific situation), forum posts (delayed responses, text-only), ChatGPT/Claude (require you to stop and type, analyze static images only), or expensive in-person instruction (not scalable, not always available)

**It (Primary Differentiators):** Uses Gemini Live's real-time video streaming to maintain continuous visual awareness of your workspace - seeing hazards as they develop, not after you upload a photo. Responds with voice so your hands never leave your work. Acts proactively for safety (speaks first) and reactively for troubleshooting (you ask, it diagnoses from sight).

## Extended Positioning Details

### Target User Profiles

| Segment | Key Need | How We Help |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Solo Home Hobbyist** | Safety when working alone at night/weekends | Always-watching safety monitor that catches fatigue mistakes |
| **Makerspace Newbie** | Guidance without bothering busy staff | Patient AI mentor available 24/7, no judgment |
| **Experienced Maker** | Quick troubleshooting for weird failures | Visual diagnosis that understands context |
| **Educator/Instructor** | Scalable oversight for multiple students | Extra pair of eyes that never gets distracted |

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | What They Do | Their Limitation | Our Advantage |
|------------|--------------|------------------|---------------|
| **YouTube Tutorials** | Step-by-step video guides | Can't see YOUR workspace, can't answer questions in real-time | We see your specific situation and respond live |
| **Reddit/Forums** | Community troubleshooting | Slow (hours/days), text-based, need to describe problems | Instant visual analysis, just show the problem |
| **ChatGPT/Claude** | General AI assistance | Static image analysis, text-first, must stop working to interact | Continuous video, voice-first, hands stay on work |
| **Makerspace Staff** | Human expertise | Not always available, can't watch everyone | Always on, scales infinitely |
| **Safety Sensors** | Equipment-specific alerts | Only detect specific conditions (smoke, heat) | Understands context, sees human behavior |

### The Two-Feature Focus

**Feature 1: Safety Monitor (Proactive)**
- Watches continuously via webcam
- Speaks up WITHOUT being asked
- Catches: missing PPE, dangerous hand positions, improper technique, environmental hazards
- Voice: Calm, direct, non-judgmental ("I notice you're not wearing safety glasses...")

**Feature 2: Visual Troubleshooter (Reactive)**
- Activated when user asks
- Analyzes what it sees in real-time
- Handles: 3D print failures, laser cutter issues, basic woodworking problems, slicer/design tool questions
- Voice: Diagnostic, specific, actionable ("I can see layer separation here, which typically means...")

### Tools We Support (Scope)

**In Scope:**
- 3D Printers (FDM focus): Bed leveling, adhesion, stringing, layer issues, supports
- Laser Cutters: Power/speed settings, material selection, safety protocols, cut quality
- Basic Woodworking: Table saws, miter saws, drills - safety and basic technique
- Design Tools: Inkscape (vectors), Tinkercad (simple 3D), Cura/PrusaSlicer (slicing)

**Explicitly Out of Scope:**
- Complex CAD (Fusion 360, SolidWorks, AutoCAD, Rhino)
- CNC machining
- Welding
- Electronics/soldering
- Advanced manufacturing equipment

### Key Messages

**For Pitch Deck:**
> "WorkshopCopilot is Claude in Chrome for physical workshops - an AI that watches your workspace through a webcam, warns you about safety hazards, and diagnoses problems when you show them."

**For Technical Judges:**
> "We use Gemini Live API's real-time video streaming to maintain continuous spatial awareness of a physical workspace, enabling both proactive safety interventions and reactive visual troubleshooting - all through natural voice interaction."

**For Impact Judges:**
> "400,000 Americans visit ERs for workshop injuries annually. Most were working alone. WorkshopCopilot provides the safety oversight and instant expertise that could prevent these injuries and help more people confidently learn hands-on skills."

**One-Liner:**
> "The AI mentor that watches your workshop - warns you before you get hurt, helps you when you're stuck."
