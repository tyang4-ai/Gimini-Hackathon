# WorkshopCopilot Pitch Plan

## The Hook

**Opening Line:**
> "Every year, 400,000 Americans visit emergency rooms for workshop injuries. Most of them were working alone when it happened."

**Alternative Hook (demo-forward):**
> "Watch what happens when I reach toward this spinning blade without safety glasses..."

## The Problem

### The Maker's Dilemma

**1. Information Fragmentation**
- YouTube tutorials pause at the wrong moment
- Forum answers don't match your specific situation
- Manuals assume you already know what you're doing
- You can't Google while your hands are covered in sawdust

**2. Safety Gaps**
- No one's watching when you work alone (and most makers work alone)
- Fatigue makes you skip safety checks at 2 AM
- Beginners don't know what they don't know
- One moment of distraction = permanent injury

**3. The Learning Cliff**
- Makerspaces have tools but not always mentors
- Experts are expensive and not always available
- Trial and error is costly (failed prints, ruined material, damaged tools)
- Getting stuck means abandoned projects

**The Core Tension:**
Makers want to create, but they're one mistake away from injury or failure, and there's no one watching their back.

## The Insight

### Why Now?

**What Changed:** Gemini Live API enables real-time, continuous video understanding with natural voice interaction.

**Before Gemini Live:**
- AI could analyze a single image you upload
- You had to stop working to ask for help
- No continuous awareness of your environment
- Text-based responses while your hands are busy

**After Gemini Live:**
- AI watches your workspace continuously
- Speaks up proactively when it sees danger
- You ask questions with your voice, hands-free
- Real-time visual understanding, not static snapshots

**The Unlock:**
For the first time, AI can be a pair of eyes that never blinks, watching your workshop the way a mentor would - seeing problems before they become disasters.

## The Solution

### WorkshopCopilot: One Paragraph

WorkshopCopilot is an AI workshop assistant that watches your workspace through a webcam and acts as a vigilant mentor. It does two things exceptionally well: **proactively warns you about safety hazards** (no glasses, hand too close, improper technique) and **reactively troubleshoots problems when you're stuck** (show it your failed 3D print, explain what happened, get a diagnosis). It's Claude in Chrome, but for your physical workshop - always watching, always helpful, voice-first so your hands stay on your work.

## The Demo Moments

### Moment 1: The Safety Save (30 seconds)
*The "holy shit" moment*

- Demonstrator reaches toward a running tool without safety glasses
- WorkshopCopilot immediately speaks: "Hold on - I don't see safety glasses, and you're about to work with the laser cutter. Let's fix that first."
- Demonstrator puts on glasses, continues
- **Judge reaction:** "It actually saw that and stopped them"

### Moment 2: The Visual Diagnosis (45 seconds)
*The "that's actually useful" moment*

- Show a 3D print with visible layer separation/stringing
- Say: "Hey, what went wrong with this print?"
- WorkshopCopilot analyzes: "I can see layer separation starting around the 30% mark, and there's stringing between the towers. This usually means heat creep - your hotend is getting too warm. Try reducing your printing temperature by 5 degrees and adding more part cooling. Also, that overhang on the left needed supports."
- **Judge reaction:** "It diagnosed a real problem from just looking at it"

### Moment 3: The Hands-Free Flow (30 seconds)
*The "I want this" moment*

- Demonstrator has both hands on a piece of wood, positioning for a cut
- Voice: "Is this the right angle for a miter joint?"
- WorkshopCopilot: "You're at about 40 degrees - for a miter joint you want exactly 45. Rotate clockwise just a bit... there, that looks right."
- **Judge reaction:** "They never had to stop working"

## The Analogy

### "Claude in Chrome for Workshops"

**What Claude in Chrome Does:**
- Watches your browser continuously
- Understands context from what's on screen
- Helps you navigate, fill forms, accomplish tasks
- Proactively assists based on what it sees

**What WorkshopCopilot Does:**
- Watches your workshop continuously
- Understands context from your physical workspace
- Helps you work safely, diagnose problems, learn techniques
- Proactively warns based on what it sees

**The Translation:**
Claude in Chrome brought AI assistance to digital work. WorkshopCopilot brings it to physical work. Same concept - continuous visual awareness + intelligent assistance - different domain.

**Why This Analogy Works for Judges:**
- Instantly communicates the interaction model
- Shows we understand the frontier of AI assistance
- Positions us as extending proven concepts to new territory
- Makes the innovation feel inevitable, not gimmicky

## The Impact

### Market Size

**Immediate Market:**
- 135 million Americans do DIY/home improvement projects
- 1,400+ makerspaces in the US alone
- 3D printing market: $18B and growing 20% annually
- Home workshop equipment: $9B market

**Target Users:**
1. **Makerspace Members** - Access to tools, need guidance
2. **Home Workshop Hobbyists** - Work alone, safety concerns
3. **Educators/Students** - Learning environments need oversight
4. **Small-Batch Manufacturers** - Need efficiency, can't afford mistakes

### Who Benefits

**Individuals:**
- Fewer injuries from working alone
- Faster learning curve on new tools
- Less wasted material from failed attempts
- More confidence to try new projects

**Makerspaces:**
- Scalable safety oversight (can't have a human watch everyone)
- Reduced liability from accidents
- Better member experience and retention
- Enables more self-service usage

**The Scalable Vision:**
Start with makerspaces and home workshops. Expand to vocational training, manufacturing floors, construction sites - anywhere humans work with physical tools and could use an always-watching safety net.

### Impact Statement
> "WorkshopCopilot makes solo making safer and troubleshooting instant. It's the mentor you wish you had, watching over your shoulder 24/7."

## The Ask

### What We Want Judges to Take Away

**Primary Takeaway:**
"This is a genuinely novel use of Gemini Live - real-time video understanding applied to physical safety and hands-on troubleshooting. It's not a chatbot with a camera bolted on."

**Secondary Takeaways:**
1. **Technical:** "They actually used live video streaming and proactive AI intervention - this showcases what Gemini 3 can do."
2. **Innovation:** "Bringing AI assistance to physical workspaces is an underexplored frontier with real impact."
3. **Impact:** "This could prevent real injuries and help real people learn real skills."
4. **Demo Quality:** "The safety intervention moment was memorable. I'd actually use this."

### The One Sentence

If judges remember one thing:
> "WorkshopCopilot is the AI that watches your workshop like a mentor - warning you before you get hurt and helping you fix things when you're stuck."
