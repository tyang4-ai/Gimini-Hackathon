# WorkshopCopilot Pitch Plan v2

## The Hook

**Opening (Demo-Forward):**
> "Watch what happens when I reach toward this spinning blade without safety glasses..."

*[Demo plays: AI interrupts before contact]*

> "That moment I just showed you? It could have been one of 30,000 finger amputations this year. Most of those people were working alone when it happened."

## The Problem

### The Maker's Dilemma

**1. No One's Watching**
- Most makers work alone - garage at midnight, basement on weekends
- Fatigue makes you skip safety checks
- One moment of distraction = permanent injury
- There's no second pair of eyes when you need them most

**2. No One to Ask**
- YouTube tutorials pause at the wrong moment and can't see YOUR workspace
- Forum answers take hours and don't match your specific situation
- You can't Google while your hands are covered in sawdust
- Getting stuck means abandoned projects and wasted material

**The Core Tension:**
Makers want to create, but they're one mistake away from injury or failure, and there's no one watching their back.

## The Insight

### Why This Matters Now

**What Changed:** Gemini Live API enables real-time, continuous video understanding with natural voice interaction.

**Before Gemini Live:**
- AI analyzed single images you uploaded
- You had to stop working to ask for help
- No continuous awareness of your environment
- Text responses while your hands are busy

**After Gemini Live:**
- AI watches your workspace continuously
- Speaks up proactively when it sees danger
- You ask questions with your voice, hands-free
- Real-time visual understanding, not static snapshots

**The Unlock:**
For the first time, AI can be like having an experienced shop mentor always watching - seeing problems before they become disasters, answering questions without you putting down your tools.

## The Solution

### WorkshopCopilot: One Paragraph

WorkshopCopilot is your 24/7 shop mentor - an AI that watches your workspace through a webcam and acts like an experienced peer who's always looking over your shoulder. It does two things exceptionally well: **proactively warns you about safety hazards** (no glasses, hand too close, improper technique) and **reactively troubleshoots problems when you're stuck** (show it your failed 3D print, explain what happened, get a diagnosis). Voice-first, so your hands never leave your work.

---

## The Demo Moments

### Moment 1: The Safety Save (30 seconds)
*The "holy shit" moment*

- Demonstrator reaches toward a running tool without safety glasses
- WorkshopCopilot immediately speaks: "Hold on - I don't see safety glasses, and you're about to work with the laser cutter. Let's fix that first."
- Demonstrator puts on glasses, continues
- **Judge reaction:** "It actually saw that and stopped them"

### Moment 2: The Visual Diagnosis (45 seconds)
*The "that's actually useful" moment*

- Show a 3D print with visible layer separation/stringing
- Say: "Hey, what went wrong with this print?"
- WorkshopCopilot analyzes: "I can see layer separation starting around the 30% mark, and there's stringing between the towers. This usually means heat creep - your hotend is getting too warm. Try reducing your printing temperature by 5 degrees and adding more part cooling. Also, that overhang on the left needed supports."
- **Judge reaction:** "It diagnosed a real problem from just looking at it"

### Moment 3: Material Intelligence (30 seconds)
*The "it knows more than me" moment*

- Demonstrator holds up an unlabeled piece of material toward the camera
- Voice: "I found this in the scrap bin. What is it and what settings should I use?"
- WorkshopCopilot: "That looks like 3mm Baltic birch plywood based on the edge grain layers. For your laser cutter, I'd suggest 15mm/s speed at 80% power for a clean cut. Do a test cut in the corner first - some plywoods have inconsistent glue layers."
- **Judge reaction:** "It identified the material AND gave specific machine settings"

## The Analogy

### Your 24/7 Shop Mentor

**The Human Equivalent:**
Think about the ideal workshop situation - an experienced maker friend who watches over your shoulder. They stop you before you hurt yourself. They answer questions when you're stuck. They know what that weird material is and what settings to use. They've seen every failure mode and can diagnose problems at a glance.

**The Problem:**
That friend isn't available at 2 AM when you're finally getting to your project. They can't be at every makerspace workstation. They have their own projects.

**WorkshopCopilot:**
The experienced peer who's always watching. The workshop instructor who never goes home. The mentor you wish you had, available 24/7.

**Why This Framing Works:**
- Judges immediately understand the value proposition
- It's aspirational but achievable
- It positions the AI as augmenting human expertise, not replacing it
- It makes the use case feel inevitable, not gimmicky

## The Impact

### Who This Is Really For

**The Midnight Maker:**
Sarah works alone in her garage after her kids go to bed. She learned woodworking from YouTube. Last month she almost lost a finger reaching past a spinning blade - she was tired, it was late, and nobody was there to say "stop."

With WorkshopCopilot, there's always someone watching. Not to judge, just to catch the moment her attention slips.

**The Makerspace Newbie:**
Marcus joined his local makerspace to learn 3D printing. But the staff can't watch everyone, and asking "dumb questions" feels embarrassing. His first three prints failed and he doesn't know why.

With WorkshopCopilot, he just holds up the failed print: "What went wrong?" No judgment. Instant diagnosis. He's not alone anymore.

**The Teaching Parent:**
David is teaching his 12-year-old to use power tools. He's confident in his own skills, but his attention keeps splitting - watching his kid, managing the tool, thinking about technique.

With WorkshopCopilot, there's a second set of eyes. When his attention slips, the AI doesn't.

### The Numbers Behind the Stories

- Every year, 30,000 Americans lose fingers to table saws. Most were working alone.
- The average beginner wastes $50 in failed 3D prints before figuring out their settings.
- 1,400+ US makerspaces need safety oversight but can't afford 24/7 staffing.

**Impact Statement:**
> "WorkshopCopilot makes solo making safer and troubleshooting instant. It's the 24/7 mentor watching over your shoulder."

## The Ask

### What We Want Judges to Take Away

**Primary Takeaway:**
"This is a genuinely novel use of Gemini Live - real-time video understanding applied to physical safety and hands-on troubleshooting. It's not a chatbot with a camera bolted on."

**Secondary Takeaways:**
1. **Technical:** "They actually used live video streaming and proactive AI intervention - this showcases what Gemini 3 can do."
2. **Innovation:** "Bringing AI assistance to physical workspaces is an underexplored frontier with real impact."
3. **Impact:** "This could prevent real injuries and help real people learn real skills."
4. **Demo Quality:** "The safety intervention moment was memorable. I'd actually use this."

### The One Sentence

If judges remember one thing:
> "WorkshopCopilot - the AI that watches your workshop, stops you before you bleed, helps you when you're stuck."

## Technical Credibility Note

**What Was Hard:**
Real-time video streaming to Gemini while maintaining sub-500ms response latency for safety-critical interventions. The AI needs to catch dangerous situations faster than a human can complete a dangerous action.

**What We're NOT Trying to Do:**
We're not replacing master craftsmen or professional safety officers. We're the safety net for the hobbyist working alone at 2 AM - catching the moments when attention slips.
