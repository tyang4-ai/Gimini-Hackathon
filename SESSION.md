# Gemini 3 Hackathon - Session Context

## Project Status
- **Current Phase:** READY TO BUILD - Day 0 Validation Next
- **Last Updated:** January 28, 2026 - Session 3 - PM → Critic Pipeline COMPLETE
- **Active Agent:** None (planning complete)
- **Win Probability:** 50-55% (BUILD approved)

---

## Quick Context

### What We're Building
**Omnigenesis** - "Where Creation Never Ends"

Infinite Craft meets infinite depth. Combine anything, zoom into everything.

### Core Loop
1. **COMBINE** - Merge elements (Gemini 3 Flash + Nano Banana) - **< 2 seconds**
2. **ZOOM** - Enter any element to discover worlds inside (image generation)
3. **EVOLVE** - Watch creations develop civilizations (Veo video, async 1-2 min)

### Tech Stack
| Category | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| Framework | Next.js 14 (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| State | Zustand |
| Drag & Drop | dnd-kit |
| Animations | Framer Motion |
| Graph Viz | React Flow |
| APIs | Gemini Flash, Nano Banana, Veo 3.1 |

### Current Focus
**Day 0: API Validation** - Must validate all APIs before writing game code

### Blockers
- None (planning complete, ready to build)

---

## Research Phase Complete

### MR → Critic Pipeline (3 iterations)

| Iteration | Focus | Outcome |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| v1 | Pivot recommendations | REJECTED - User wants original plan |
| v2 | Strengthen original | ACCEPTED with reservations |
| v3 | Fun + Achievable | **BUILD WITH CAUTION** (7.5/10) |

### Key Research Findings

**Library Choices (Approved):**
- React Flow - constellation map (4-6 hrs)
- dnd-kit - drag-and-drop (3-4 hrs)
- Framer Motion - animations (trivial)

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. API Latency < 2 seconds (existential)
2. Days 5-6 Zoom System (highest risk)
3. Add technical showcase for judges
4. Pre-generate demo content Day 10

**Win Probability:** 42-55%

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Rationale | Date |
|----------|--------|-----------|------|
| Pivot from Sir Reginald | Omnigenesis | Showcase all Gemini 3 modalities | Jan 28 |
| Keep full scope | Combine + Zoom + Evolve | User preference, full breadth | Jan 28 |
| Reject pivot suggestions | Stick to original | User wants playable game | Jan 28 |
| Library choices | dnd-kit, React Flow, Framer Motion | Simple, achievable, polished | Jan 28 |
| Evolution priority | P2 (not P1) | Veo unreliable, focus on core | Jan 28 |
| Technical Showcase priority | P0 (not P1) | 40% judging weight on tech | Jan 28 |
| Buffer days | Days 9-10 | Schedule needs slack | Jan 28 |
| AI-assisted dev model | 50% debug time | Claude Code is fast but buggy | Jan 28 |

## Session Log

### January 28, 2026 - Session 3 - PM → CRITIC PIPELINE
**Duration:** ~1 hour
**Focus:** PM → Critic pipeline (2 iterations)

**Accomplishments:**
- PM created comprehensive spec v4 (1500+ lines)
- Critic reviewed v4: REVISE (6.5/10, 35% win prob)
- PM revised to v5 with AI-assisted dev reality
- Critic reviewed v5: BUILD (7.5/10, 50-55% win prob)
- All 10 critic concerns addressed
- GitHub updated and pushed

**Key Changes (v4 → v5):**
- Evolution demoted P1 → P2 (Veo unreliable)
- Technical Showcase promoted P1 → P0 (40% judging)
- Days 9-10 now buffer, not Evolution
- Added AI-assisted dev model (50% debug time)
- Added error states, rate limiting, image caching
- Added pre-computed demo path strategy

**Final Spec:** `pm_product-spec_omnigenesis_v5.md`
**Final Review:** `critic_omnigenesis-review_v4.md`

**STATUS: PLANNING COMPLETE - READY FOR DAY 0**

**Next Session:**
1. Day 0: Create API validation scripts
2. Test Gemini Flash (50 calls, p95 < 1.5s)
3. Test Imagen 3 (30 images, p95 < 2s)
4. Check Veo 3.1 access (if denied → cut Evolution)
5. Pre-generate 12 primordial images
6. GO/NO-GO decision before any game code
