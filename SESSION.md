# Gemini 3 Hackathon - Session Context

## Project Status
- **Current Phase:** PLANNING - PM → Critic Pipeline
- **Last Updated:** January 28, 2026 - Session 2 - MR pipeline complete
- **Active Agent:** Product Manager
- **Win Probability:** 42-55% (after MR refinement)

---

## Quick Context

### What We're Building
**Omnigenesis** - "Where Creation Never Ends"

Infinite Craft meets infinite depth. Combine anything, zoom into everything.

### Core Loop
1. **COMBINE** - Merge elements (Gemini 3 Flash + Nano Banana) - **< 2 seconds**
2. **ZOOM** - Enter any element to discover worlds inside (image generation)
3. **EVOLVE** - Watch creations develop civilizations (Veo video, async 1-2 min)

### Tech Stack
| Category | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| Framework | Next.js 14 (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| State | Zustand |
| Drag & Drop | dnd-kit |
| Animations | Framer Motion |
| Graph Viz | React Flow |
| APIs | Gemini Flash, Nano Banana, Veo 3.1 |

### Current Focus
Finalizing development plan and architecture via PM → Critic pipeline

### Blockers
- None

---

## Research Phase Complete

### MR → Critic Pipeline (3 iterations)

| Iteration | Focus | Outcome |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| v1 | Pivot recommendations | REJECTED - User wants original plan |
| v2 | Strengthen original | ACCEPTED with reservations |
| v3 | Fun + Achievable | **BUILD WITH CAUTION** (7.5/10) |

### Key Research Findings

**Library Choices (Approved):**
- React Flow - constellation map (4-6 hrs)
- dnd-kit - drag-and-drop (3-4 hrs)
- Framer Motion - animations (trivial)

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. API Latency < 2 seconds (existential)
2. Days 5-6 Zoom System (highest risk)
3. Add technical showcase for judges
4. Pre-generate demo content Day 10

**Win Probability:** 42-55%

## Session Log

### January 28, 2026 - Session 2 - RESEARCH PIPELINE
**Duration:** ~1.5 hours
**Focus:** MR → Critic pipeline (3 iterations)

**Accomplishments:**
- Ran Market Researcher 3 times with different focuses
- Ran Critic 3 times to validate findings
- Iteration 1: Rejected pivot recommendations (user preference)
- Iteration 2: Accepted strengthening recommendations
- Iteration 3: Finalized fun-focused, achievable approach
- Selected libraries: dnd-kit, React Flow, Framer Motion
- Win probability refined to 42-55%

**Key Insights:**
